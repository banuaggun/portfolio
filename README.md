# My Portfolio 

Hi, I'm Banu AĞGÜN, UX & Ui Designer, Frontend Developer. I love designing user experiences, coding responsive interfaces, and learning new skills. I am currently focused on building visually stunning frontend web applications.

## About Me

I am proficient in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Bootstrap, TailwindCss, Sass.

I can use design tools such as Adobe XD, Figma.

I am familiar with UX processes such as user research, prototyping, testing. 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
